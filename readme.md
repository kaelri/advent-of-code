My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Written for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

To run a solution, e.g. Day 1:

```shell
npm run solve 1
```

The runner defaults to the most recent year (`2024`). To run a previous yearâ€™s solution, e.g. 2022 Day 3:

```shell
npm run solve 2022-3
```
